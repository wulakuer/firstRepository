			<p>Mammut, also known as a Mastodon, was a mammutid proboscidean which lived approximately 5 million to 10,000 years ago – from the Late Miocene Period through the Late Pleistocene Period. It was first discovered in the late 18th century and was named by Georges Cuvier in 1799. The name Mastodon means “nipple tooth.”</p>
